K-Pop Discovery Filter for Spotify
👉 Live Demo site: https://aliya-create.github.io/Better-K-Pop-Discovery-Filter-for-Spotify/

The Problem
K-pop fans currently waste 10+ minutes per discovery session jumping between:

1. Generic Spotify playlists
2. YouTube concept searches
3. Twitter recommendations
4. Back to Spotify to actually play the music

Why? Current streaming services are playlist-centric, but fans think in fandom taxonomies:

1. Era (2nd Gen, 3rd Gen, 4th Gen)
2. Concept (Dark, Bright, Healing, Performance)
3. Group Type (Boy Group, Girl Group, Solo, Co-ed)

The Solution
A dedicated K-pop discovery surface with smart filters and vertical swipe navigation like TikTok, but for music discovery.
Key Features

1. Live Spotify Embeds — Real player with 30-sec previews
2. Smart Filters — Era (2nd/3rd/4th Gen) + Concept (Dark/Bright/Healing/Performance) + Group Type (Boy/Girl/Solo)
3. Swipeable Feed — Vertical swipe navigation (mobile) + mouse wheel (desktop) + keyboard arrows
4. Quick Actions — Save, Add to Playlist, Follow Artist with instant feedback
5. Artist Photos — High-quality images with era/concept/group tags

Context & Research

Market Opportunity
360% growth in global K-pop streams (2018-2024)
5.4M saves on Spotify's K-Pop ON! playlists
Target demo: 18-34 year olds, mobile-first, multi-stans

User Insights
Fans use fandom taxonomies to describe music taste
Era/Concept/Mood are primary discovery filters
Current playlists feel too generic and uncurated
Fans want to collect and organize tracks like photocards

Competitive Gap
Apple Music: Only has genre playlists
YouTube Music: Video-first, weak audio discovery
Spotify advantage: Best recommendation engine + creator tools
