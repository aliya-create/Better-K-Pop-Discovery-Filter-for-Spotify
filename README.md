## Better K‑Pop Discovery Filter for Spotify

A mini‑MVP that helps K‑Pop fans find the *right* tracks in under 2 minutes using fandom language – era, concept, and group type; instead of generic playlists.

## The Problem

K‑Pop fans currently bounce between:

- Generic Spotify playlists  
- YouTube concept / stage searches  
- Social recommendations (X/Twitter, TikTok, Insta)  
- Then back to Spotify to actually listen

Streaming apps are **playlist‑centric**, but fans are **era‑ and concept‑centric**, especially multi‑stans trying to keep up with 2nd/3rd/4th gen groups.

## The Solution

A **K‑Pop‑only discovery surface** that sits on top of Spotify and speaks fandom language.

**Core idea:** Pick your Era + Concept + Group Type → get a short vertical feed of tracks you can swipe through and save instantly.

## Key Features

- **Live Spotify embeds**  
  30‑second previews with play/pause right inside the feed.

- **Smart filters**  
  - Era: 2nd Gen / 3rd Gen / 4th Gen  
  - Concept: Dark / Bright / Healing / Performance  
  - Group type: Boy Group / Girl Group / Solo / Co-ed

- **Swipeable feed**  
  - Vertical swipe on mobile  
  - Mouse wheel + keyboard arrows on desktop  

- **Quick actions**  
  Save to library, add to playlist, and follow artist with immediate feedback.

- **Artist context**  
  High‑quality photos and tags showing era, concept, and group type, so the feed feels like browsing photocards, not a plain list.

  ## Why This Matters

- K‑Pop streams have grown massively in the last few years, and Spotify’s K‑Pop playlists collect millions of saves.  
- Fans already organize their taste around Era / Concept / Mood – the UI just needs to catch up.  
- For a product or growth team, this mini‑MVP shows how to:
  - Translate **qualitative fandom behavior** into filters and UX.  
  - Use a **short, focused flow** to cut time‑to‑first‑new‑track.  
  - Build a feature that could plug into existing recommendation systems.
